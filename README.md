# cefgui

OpenGL GUI implementation using Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF). Development
in progress.

## To Do

- ~~better handling of resizing window~~
- ~~send mouse and keyboard events to browser~~
- implement javascript callbacks

## Notes

- libcef.so exceeds Github's file size limit so not included in repo.
- current example made for Arch Linux with OpenGL version 3.3
- write usage instructions
- add cegui_path setting rather than using hardcoded paths
